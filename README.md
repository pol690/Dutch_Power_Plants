### Short Description

Project on historical emissions of major Dutch combustion power plants using multi-index dataframes and CRISP-DM.


###  Motivation

The Netherlands are undergoing a major shift in the composition of the fuel for combustion power plants, which may have a significant impact on their environmental performance.  This historical analysis establishes its status quo.

##### 2 Netherlands_power_plant_history.ipynb 

Jupyter notebook with code written in Python 3.

### Packages

pandas 0.23.4 
numpy 1.12.1 
scikit-learn 0.18.1 
scipy 0.19.0
seaborn 0.9.0

### Outcomes

1. The amount of power plants in the Netherlands, producing more emissions during 2007â€“2014 than in 2015, was not constant and exhibited apparent trends.
2. Difference in environmental performance between smaller power plants in the Netherlands is bigger than between larger ones.
3.  The proposed environmental scoring system can successfully used in further studies.
